This was a project of mine involving my favorite franchise Pokemon. This simple site was designed to keep pokemon mainline games and some merch
listed and allow users to bookmark desired products so they may quickly and easily jump to the URL and check pricing for products of interest.
I created this while I myself was doing some collecting for games and other products as a fun activity. 

To run, in terminal enter the following:
node server.js

this will initialize the tables required and import CSV files which can be freely modified to suit any genre or other franchises and products. Enjoy! :)
